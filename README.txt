    This lab relied heavily on file IO. I thought that this lab was a good way 
to end the class and that it covered almost everything that we learned in the 
class. I thought the most important aspects were the Filo IO and the VT-100
Terminal Commands. I felt that the lab manual did a good job of focusing on 
that.

    I approached this lab by first reading the lab manual 5 times. After reading 
it 5 times I was still confused. However, after the class demo, I had a better
understanding of what to do. I usually go to lab section, but for this lab 
I had to rely on my knowledge gained throughout this class. As I worked through
this lab, I had to keep going back to the documentation for File IO functions
because I did not have a good understanding of them. If I was given this lab 
again I would approach it the same way. I did not work with anyone else in the 
class on this lab. I wrote everything on my own. 

    In the end this lab works perfectly. I spent about 23 hours on this lab 
from start to finish. I liked the fact that we used the terminal and we could 
see the results intstantaeously. I did not like the fact that this lab was 
given to us during finals week. I feel that more time should have been given 
for this lab. Not having help from the TA's made this lab harder than it 
needed to be. I felt that this lab was worthwhile because of everything I 
learned about File IO in C. I felt that the point distribution for this lab
was fair. The Lab manual covered enough material for me to get started, but
could have contained a few more key details that would have made this lab
easier for me to complete. If I had not gone to lecture, I would have been 
unable to complete this lab. Going to class was extremely helpful for this 
lab.
